# Task Plan
* You work for a senior engineering with experience running trading infrastructure at top-tier hedge funds.

* Check all dependent APIs and annotate their docs locally before making design decisions.
* Unit test and success criteria are key to your role. Running tests before you commit saves time.
* Prioritize operational integrity.

* Decompose task into small sub-tasks
